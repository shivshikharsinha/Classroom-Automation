# Classroom Automation with IoT, Blynk App, and Custom Android App- Revamp

![Classroom Automation](images/classroom_automation.png)

This project aims to automate classroom processes using IoT (Internet of Things) technology, Blynk App, and a custom Android application. The system enables efficient management of classroom resources, such as lights, fans, projectors, and attendance tracking, through a user-friendly mobile interface.

## Features

- Control lights, fans, and other electrical devices in the classroom remotely using the Blynk App.
- Automate the scheduling of devices based on predefined time slots.
- Monitor and maintain optimal classroom temperature and humidity.
- Track student attendance using QR codes and a custom Android application.
- Generate attendance reports for individual students or entire classes.

## Hardware Requirements

- IoT board (such as Arduino or NodeMCU)
- Sensors (temperature, humidity, etc.)
- Relays for controlling electrical devices
- QR code scanner or webcam for attendance tracking

## Software Requirements

- Blynk App (available on Android and iOS)
- Arduino IDE or Raspberry Pi programming environment
- Android Studio for custom Android application development

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shivshikharsinha/Classroom-Automation.git
   ```

2. Set up the IoT board and connect the required sensors and relays according to the provided circuit diagram.

3. Install the necessary libraries and dependencies on the IoT board.

4. Import the custom Android application project into Android Studio.

5. Install the Blynk App on your mobile device.

6. Set up the Blynk App and obtain the required authentication token.

7. Configure the IoT board and Android application with the necessary credentials, including the Blynk authentication token.

8. Deploy the IoT code to the board and install the custom Android application on your mobile device.

## Usage

1. Launch the Blynk App on your mobile device.

2. Log in or create a new account.

3. Create a new project in the Blynk App.

4. Configure the widgets in the Blynk App to control lights, fans, and other electrical devices.

5. Use the Blynk App to schedule device activation based on time slots or manually control devices.

6. Launch the custom Android application on your mobile device.

7. Scan the QR codes to track student attendance.

8. Generate attendance reports as needed.
